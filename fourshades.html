    <h1 class="fourshades-title">THE FOURSHADES</h1>
    <p class="fourshades-desc">
        The Four Shades are powerful entities that embody chaos, cunning, and influence across Teyvat. The Four Shades are tasked by the Heavenly Principles with governing over the metaphysical laws of Teyvat. They are implied to be more powerful than the Seven Archons and each holds sway over secrets and darkness in unique ways.

        <h2 class="ronova">RONOVA</h2>
        <p>
            Ronova is the Shade of Death, known for enforcing the laws of mortality and overseeing the balance between life and ending. 
            She is a formidable force whose presence looms wherever death or the cessation of life’s cycle is at play.
        </p>
        <p>
            In lore she has been involved in events like the Curse of Immortality affecting Khaenri’ah, demonstrating her power over life’s final threshold and fate.
        </p>

        <h2 class="naberius">NABERIUS</h2>
        <p>
            Naberius is the Shade of Life, once governing the essence of living things and the force behind existence’s spark. 
            In recent lore, her essence became fused with the alchemist Rhinedottir, transforming how her influence persists in Teyvat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her fusion with Rhinedottir links divine life power with mortal ingenuity, leaving lasting impacts on creations like Albedo and Durin.
        </p>

        <h2 class="istaroth">ISTAROTH</h2>
        <p>
            Istaroth is the Shade of Time, a mysterious and ancient force whose influence shapes history and possibility across eras. 
            Her decisions and whispers touch civilizations in ways both subtle and profound.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a Shade tied to temporal laws, Istaroth’s perspective stretches beyond mortal lives, weaving through the flow of time itself.
        </p>


        <h2 class="asmoday">ASMODAY</h2>
        <p>
            Asmoday is the Shade of Space, famously known as the divine being who intervened when the Traveler and their twin attempted to leave Teyvat. 
            She wielded the authority of space itself to halt their departure, cementing her legacy in the world’s opening tales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her dominion over spatial laws marks her as one of the most enigmatic of the Four Shades, her motives and whereabouts often wrapped in mystery.
