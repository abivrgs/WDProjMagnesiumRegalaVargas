      <p class="lore-text">
        Genshin Impact begins with two siblings, known as the Travelers, who journey between worlds. When they arrive in the world of Teyvat, they are stopped by a mysterious god known as the Unknown God, who separates them and seals away one of their siblings. The remaining Traveler awakens years later and begins a journey across Teyvat to find their lost twin.
        <br><br>
        Along the way, the Traveler is guided by Paimon and explores different nations, each ruled by a god known as an Archon. As they travel, they uncover secrets about the gods, the world’s past, and a fallen ancient civilization called Khaenri’ah, which is closely tied to their sibling’s disappearance. What starts as a search for family slowly evolves into a deeper quest to uncover the truth behind Teyvat and its hidden past.
