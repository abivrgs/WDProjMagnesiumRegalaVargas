### VII. Page 8 - Traveler's Card
#### This page shows a themed card/profile of the user/traveler from the data collected from page 6. This isn't that improtant, it really just adds more design and pop to our website while also showing the user's cool and diverse theme from their choices. This page provides:
- A themed background and images depending on the user's favorite region, prefered element and archon.
- A textlink where the user will be redirected to Genshin's official website where news and announcements are uploaded there

### Purpose and Use of the HTML Form:
### The HTML form is designed to collect user information for the Teyvat Explorer Profile section of our Genshin Impact–themed website. Its main purpose is to allow users to create a personalized explorer profile based on their preferences in the game, such as their favorite region, element, and archon. The form is used as an interactive input for the website where users provide their details. Once submitted, the information is saved on the user’s computer and reused on other webpages of the website to display customized content. This makes the website more engaging and personalized, as users can see information that reflects their own choices and interests.
#### This feature will make use of JavaScript to:
- Handle user input and events (e.g., clicks, form submissions)
- Validate user's inputs before processing
- On other webpages of the website, JavaScript will retrieve the stored user data and use conditional statements to determine what content should be displayed
- JavaScript will also be used to dynamically update page text and sections based on the stored data
