      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Mondstadt is a breezy land full of fields, cliffs, and peaceful lakes, with the city itself built on an island surrounded by water. Strong winds shape the region, from the open grasslands to places like Stormterror’s Lair, giving Mondstadt a very free and relaxed vibe.

The Anemo (Wind) Archon Venti (Barbatos) watches over the region but doesn’t rule directly, letting people live freely. One major event was the Stormterror crisis, where Dvalin was corrupted and later saved with the Traveler’s help. Mondstadt’s story focuses on freedom and choice, which fits perfectly with its wind element.

      <img src="assets/li2.JPG" class="img2" height="400px" width="800px">
      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Liyue is known for its massive stone mountains, glowing golden cliffs, and busy ports like Liyue Harbor, which is the center of trade. The region feels ancient and solid, with landscapes shaped by contracts, history, and tradition.

The Geo (Earth) Archon Zhongli (Morax) once ruled Liyue but chose to step down during the Rite of Descension, faking his own death to see if humans could govern themselves. This was a huge turning point for the nation. Geo represents stability and endurance, which matches Liyue’s strong respect for order and agreements.

      <img src="assets/in2.JPG" class="img2" height="400px" width="800px">
      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Inazuma is a chain of islands surrounded by stormy seas and constant lightning. The region has sakura-covered mountains, broken battlefields, and dangerous zones affected by Electro energy, making it feel tense and isolated.

It is ruled by the Electro (Lightning) Archon Raiden Ei, who enforced the Vision Hunt Decree in her pursuit of eternity. This caused conflict, resistance, and even civil war across the nation. Eventually, Ei realizes that change is unavoidable, reflecting the unpredictable and powerful nature of the Electro element.

    <p>
      <img src="assets/sum.JPG" class="img" height="400px" width="800px"> 
      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Sumeru has two very different environments: lush rainforests filled with giant trees and wildlife, and a massive desert full of ruins and ancient secrets. This contrast shows both growth and decay, making the region feel alive and complex.

The Dendro (Nature) Archon Nahida (Lesser Lord Kusanali) leads Sumeru, a nation that values knowledge above all else. Major events include exposing the Akademiya’s corruption and breaking the endless dream loop during the Sabzeruz Festival. Dendro fits Sumeru well, symbolizing life, learning, and the responsibility that comes with wisdom.

      <img src="assets/fon2.JPG" class="img2" height="400px" width="800px">
      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Fontaine is a highly advanced nation filled with waterfalls, canals, and underwater areas, all powered by Hydro technology. The city designs feel elegant and mechanical at the same time, showing how deeply water is tied to everyday life there.

The Hydro (Water) Archon Furina is deeply connected to Fontaine’s focus on justice and trials. The region’s story revolves around dramatic court cases and the looming prophecy that Fontaine will sink. Hydro represents emotion, truth, and change, which matches Fontaine’s obsession with judgment and morality.

      <img src="assets/nat.JPG" class="img" height="400px" width="800px">
      <div style="text-align:justify">
      Natlan is a wild and dangerous land with volcanic landscapes, scorched plains, and rough mountains. Everything about the region suggests constant battle and survival, making it feel intense and full of energy.

Ruled by the Pyro (Fire) Archon Murata, Natlan is known as the nation of war. While not much is revealed yet, it’s clear that strength, honor, and combat play a huge role in daily life. The Pyro element reflects the passion, aggression, and burning spirit of its people.
